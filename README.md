# Text Analyser

Text Analyser is a simple yet powerful React application that allows users to input text or a paragraph and get immediate feedback on various metrics such as character count, word count, and the number of characters left for a LinkedIn or Twitter/X post. This project has been a valuable learning experience and has helped me with my academic assignment writing.

## Features

- **Character Count**: Displays the total number of characters in the input text.
- **Word Count**: Displays the total number of words in the input text.
- **LinkedIn Character Limit**: Shows how many characters are left for a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters).
- **Twitter/X Character Limit**: Shows how many characters are left for a Twitter/X post (max 280 characters).
